The Nasa Fitness web application is developed as a separate project for doctors and patients by UHCL Students.
All of these projects are developed in .NET Framework.They have two websites that are used by them on daily basis: NasaFitness (www.nasafitness.com) and SpaceChiro (www.spacechiro.com).

We have converted website into responsive designing by integrating Bootstrap CSS Library so it looks user-friendly and responsive to end users.

Now, this application has patient processing module through which if patient is not a part of any chiropractic center, administrator of this application will send a link to patients and patients will add their personal information, primary and secondary health insurance. 
Next steps for them would be agreed to share their medical history by signing the form using DocuSign â€“ Digital Signature Platform, HIPAA and Informed Consent. 
Created base for company module so multiple application will be generated based on number of chiropractic center.
So, each center will have access to their own patients and their data.
Major task of this project to deploy this project on Microsoft Azure and migration of current databases to the existing database.
